## Pull Requests

### Before Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commit format
6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use the following format for branch names:

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation changes
- `chore/description` - for maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feature/add-policy-comparison`
- `fix/pdf-upload-error`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat: add policy comparison feature
fix: resolve PDF upload timeout issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: extract policy analysis logic
test: add unit tests for coverage analysis
chore: update dependencies
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update the README.md** with details of changes if applicable
2. **Update the API documentation** if you're changing endpoints
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
5. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** with a brief description of your changes

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (linting, tests, build)
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Address feedback** and make requested changes
4. **Maintainer approval** required for merge
